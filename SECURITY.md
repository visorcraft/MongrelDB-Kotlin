# Security

This document describes the security properties of the MongrelDB Kotlin client
and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Overview

The MongrelDB Kotlin client is a pure Kotlin/JVM library (no native
dependencies) that talks to `mongreldb-server` over HTTP using the JDK's
`java.net.HttpURLConnection`. The client itself holds no encryption keys and
stores no data at rest; it is a thin request/response layer over the daemon.

## Client security properties

- The client communicates with `mongreldb-server` over plain HTTP. The daemon
  binds to `127.0.0.1` by default - traffic stays on the loopback interface.
  For remote or multi-tenant deployments, terminate TLS in a reverse proxy
  (nginx, Caddy) in front of the daemon.
- The client supports Bearer token and HTTP Basic auth, matching the daemon's
  `--auth-token` and `--auth-users` modes. Credentials are sent only in the
  `Authorization` header and are never logged by the client.
- The native Condition API and query builder accept typed parameters (column
  ids, typed values) - no string interpolation, no SQL injection surface.
  User-supplied values are serialized as typed JSON, not concatenated into
  queries.
- SQL is sent to the daemon's DataFusion-backed `/sql` endpoint, which parses
  and parameterizes it server-side. The client never interprets SQL locally.
- Idempotency keys are caller-supplied opaque strings; the client does not
  derive or store them.
- Each request opens and closes its own `HttpURLConnection`, so credentials and
  response bodies do not leak across unrelated requests on the same client.

## Daemon security (mongreldb-server)

The client is a consumer of `mongreldb-server`. The daemon's security posture:

- Binds to `127.0.0.1` only - not accessible from other machines.
- **No authentication by default** - any local process can query, write, or
  delete data. Enable `--auth-token` or `--auth-users` for any shared host.
- No TLS - traffic is plaintext on the loopback interface.
- No rate limiting or request size caps.

For remote access or multi-tenant environments, place a reverse proxy (nginx,
Caddy) in front with TLS termination and authentication. Do not expose the
daemon directly to a network.

## Input validation

- The query builder produces typed JSON requests. Invalid column ids, value
  encodings, and numeric ranges are rejected before any request is sent.
- Non-finite doubles and floats (`NaN`, `Infinity`) are rejected by the JSON
  codec rather than emitted as invalid JSON tokens.
- Server and network errors are mapped to the typed exception hierarchy
  (`AuthException`, `NotFoundException`, `ConflictException`, `QueryException`)
  carrying the HTTP status and decoded server envelope, not leaked as generic
  exceptions.

## Dependency security

The MongrelDB Kotlin client has no runtime dependencies beyond the Kotlin
standard library and the JDK. The only test-scope dependency is JUnit 5. Report
dependency vulnerabilities through GitHub's Dependabot alerts or the private
vulnerability reporting flow below.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not file a public GitHub issue, discussion, or pull request for security
problems.** Report privately through **GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting**:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab.
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Fill in the advisory form with the details below.

This keeps the report confidential between you and the maintainers until a fix
is ready. Please include as much as you can:

- a description of the issue and its impact,
- step-by-step reproduction steps,
- the MongrelDB Kotlin client version, JVM version, and OS,
- the `mongreldb-server` version if relevant,
- the relevant configuration, error output, or a proof-of-concept,
- a suggested fix or mitigation, if you have one.

### What to expect

- **Acknowledgement** of your report within a few days.
- An initial assessment and, where confirmed, a remediation plan.
- Progress updates through the private advisory thread until the issue is
  resolved.
- Credit for your responsible disclosure in the advisory, unless you prefer to
  remain anonymous.

We ask that you give us a reasonable opportunity to ship a fix before any
public disclosure.
